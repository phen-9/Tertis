Created by Gavin Gaetos-Puzon (Lab Section 8) and Logan Spinali (Lab Section 8)

Controls:
- Left Arrow Key: move falling block left one tile
- Right Arrow Key: move falling block right one tile
- Down Arrow Key: move falling block down one tile (quick fall)
- Up Arrow Key: instantly place falling block at the bottom of its current location (instant fall)
- Z Key: rotate falling block left
- X Key: rotate falling block right
- C Key: swap current block with block in hold (cannot swap twice in a row)

How to play:
- As with Tetris, the goal of Tertis is to create horizontal lines of blocks, clearing them. Clearing lines gives the player points based on how many are cleared at once.
	- 1 Line = 150 points
	- 2 Lines = 450 points
	- 3 Lines = 1000 points
	- 4 Lines = 4000 points
